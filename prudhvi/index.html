                <h1>We’ll meet you where you are.</h1>
                Then, we’ll help you get where you want to go.
                Colleges and universities of yesterday focused on giving you one choice of direction: a path they determined. And that path may, or may not, have led you toward success.
                <br> 
                Auburn University at Montgomery is different. We have a modern, practical and doable approach to helping you get a world-class education. It’s based on the idea that:
                <br>
                Classes should be small enough so that professors know your name.<br>
                Learning should be personalized, challenging and connected to the real world.<br>
                A college should know what success looks like to a student, and be able to help him/her achieve it.<br>
                Change is constant, and there are many ways to learn other than class work.<br>
                <br>                
                Each of AUM’s five colleges — Business, Sciences, Education, Liberal Arts and Social Sciences, and Nursing and Health Sciences — is led by academic professionals who care deeply about your success. Our 90+ fields of study are taught by professors with real-world experience. And class schedules are designed to fit your life—and offered days, nights, weekends and online.
